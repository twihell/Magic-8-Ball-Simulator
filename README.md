# Magic-8-Ball-Simulator
This is a one-page project that I made as an asignment for the JS Base course. 
On loading the page, you will see a magic ball at the top of the page and an HTML form below asking you to enter your name and any (YES/NO) question.
After submitting the form, you will see a randomly generated answer inside the magic ball, ranging from specific answers like 'Yes'
and 'No' to more vague-ish ones like 'Reply hazy, try again' or 'Ask again later'. After you click on the 'Ask Me' button, your name, question, and answer will be automatically saved in a table right below the submission form. However, all recorded entries will disappear after reloading the page.

You can try it here:
