# Magic-8-Ball-Simulator
This is a one-page project that I made as an asignment for the JS Base course. 
On loading the page, you will see an HTML form asking you to enter your name and any YES/NO question that comes to your mind.
After submitting the form, you will see a magic ball with a randomly generated answer, ranging from specific ones like 'Yes'
and 'No' to more vague-ish ones like 'Reply hazy, try again' or 'Ask again later'. If you want to ask another question, just refresh
the page and repeat the steps described above.
